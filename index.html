    <p>“Indoor football is a popular game played around the world, this fast paced sport is ideal for those who want to increase their fitness level, coordination, balance and agility in a friendly and social environment.”</p>
    <p><b>Studiebold</b> is an indoor soccer tournament for all higher education across Jutland and Funen. Here the teams meet each other through a series of final events. Magic with the ball, spirit on the court and coziness are at the heart of the Studiebold.

    <p>The student football rules set is inspired by Futsal where no gangs are played, as you know it from regular indoor football.
          The ball is a bit heavier that makes the ball not jump unsteady. As a player, you have better control of the ball on the hard indoor court.</p>
